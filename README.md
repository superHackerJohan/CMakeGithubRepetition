# CMakeGithubRepetition
Need to repeat some basics

# How to build:
First run the command:
cmake -B build_tree

This tells CMake where to store generated files and artifacts during the build. (Nice to create another folder for that).
Next we need to tell CMake to build:
cmake --build build_tree

Then you can ls into the the build tree and run the freshly builded application. (run it from terminal by writing:
./NameOfApplication
